## **1. Introduction**  

### **Background & Motivation**  
Over the past few decades, we have witnessed a meteoric rise in internet access worldwide. It has now become a crucial part of almost 6 billion people's lives. From students to professionals and intellectuals to business owners, the Internet assists them in their respective tasks while also providing entertainment.  

While the benefits brought by the internet, such as improved communication and access to a large database of knowledge, are well documented, it may also be behind some of the challenges we face today. Excessive internet use may be linked to declining mental health and increased distractions, raising concerns about its long-term effects.  

Therefore, I believe studying how internet usage shapes society and whether it contributes more to progress or potential harm is very important to make informed decisions and policies regarding internet use and also to maximize its benefit.  

### **Objective**
In this study, I aim to analyze the impact of rising internet usage in the USA by enriching it with datasets on various aspects like:  
- **Education performance**  
- **Productivity metrics**  
- **Mental health**  
- **Overall well-being**  

I will use publicly available data to identify patterns and correlations between internet usage and the above-mentioned aspects. The final goal is to reach meaningful insights that can help us better understand its implications on well-being and efficiency and to achieve a fruitful internet consumption balance.

## **3. Data Analysis Plan**  

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  

#### **Data Visualization:**  
To identify patterns and trends, the following visualizations will be used, along with others:  
- **Histograms & Boxplots:** Distribution of internet usage, education scores, mental health cases.  
- **Correlation Heatmaps:** Identify relationships between internet usage and dependent variables.  
- **Time-Series Plots:** Show trends over time (e.g., increase in internet use vs. mental health issues).  
- **Geospatial Maps:** Display regional variations in internet usage and its effects.  

### **Hypothesis Testing**  
To statistically validate relationships between internet usage and societal factors, the following hypotheses will be tested:  
- **H1:** Higher internet usage is correlated with lower academic performance.  
- **H2:** Excessive internet usage is associated with increased mental health issues.  
- **H3:** Internet usage influences productivity negatively.
